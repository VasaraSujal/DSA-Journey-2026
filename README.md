# 🚀 DSA Journey 2026: Mastering Algorithms & Data Structures

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey** for the year **2026**! 🌟

This repository serves as a dedicated archive of my daily progress as I tackle **LeetCode** problems, explore complex algorithms, and refine my problem-solving skills in **C++** (and potentially other languages). 

## 📖 About This Repository

This project is more than just a collection of code; it is a commitment to **consistency, growth, and engineering excellence**. My primary goal is to solve at least one problem every single day, documentation of my thought process, and optimizing solutions for time and space complexity.

**Key Objectives:**
*   🧠 **Deep Understanding**: Moving beyond "getting it right" to understanding *why* it works.
*   ⚡ **Optimization**: Always seeking the most efficient solution ($O(n)$ vs $O(n^2)$).
*   📅 **Consistency**: A daily habit of coding to keep skills sharp.
*   📚 **Knowledge Base**: Building a personal library of patterns and templates.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized chronologically to track progress throughout the year. Each folder corresponds to a month, containing solutions for that period.

```plaintext
root/
├── Jan/              # January Solutions
├── Feb/              # February Solutions
├── ...
├── README.md         # You are here!
└── .gitignore        # Ignored files
```

### File Naming Convention
Each solution file typically follows the format:
`[ProblemNumber]_[ProblemName].cpp` or `Day_[Date]_[ProblemName].cpp`
